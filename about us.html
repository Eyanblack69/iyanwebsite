            <p>The Rosales National High School which caters to secondary school youths of Rosales and its neighboring towns, 
                Rosales National High School was founded in 1945 through the initiative of public school officials and prominent
                and civic- spirited of the town, namely, the late Mayor Felix Coloma, Dona Petra Callanta, Don Francisco delos Reyes
                Don Isidro Casanova, Don Conrado Estrella Sr. In September 1945, the school then known as Rosales Junior High School

                 Plaridel College Building.</p>

            <p>    From Plaridel College, the school was transferred to another si which is currently occupied by the Rosales North
                 Central School where Quonset Buildings vacated by the American Soldiers were then used as classrooms.</p>

                 of the town.<p>
                
              <p> Assured of the funds, the PTA Board of Drectors negotiated with the henn of the late Mr. Alejandro Pablo regarding
                 the comtemplated purchase of his lot situated in the Poblacion of Rosales.</p>
